"Notes"
"The majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) by KFF. ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates."
""
"The ACS asks respondents about their health insurance coverage at the time of the survey. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage. See definitions for more detail on coverage type."
""
"Data may not sum to totals due to rounding."

"Sources"
"KFF estimates based on the 2008-2019 American Community Survey, 1-Year Estimates."

"Definitions"
"*Uninsured*: Includes those without health insurance and those who have coverage under the Indian Health Service only."
""
"*N/A*: Estimates with relative standard errors greater than 30% are not provided."
""
"*Rate*: In this case, the proportion of the population or subpopulation with no insurance."
